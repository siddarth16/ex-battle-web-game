Project Overview:
Build a modern, highly interactive web game playable entirely in the browser, where the player controls a girl fighting off waves of guys in creative, humorous ways. Boss levels are themed around her ex-boyfriends, each with unique abilities and patterns. The game should feel ultra-modern, intuitive, and visually advanced, with smooth transitions, responsive controls, and engaging sound effects. It should work on both desktop and mobile browsers.
1. Core Gameplay & Mechanics

    Player Character:

        The main character is a confident, stylish girl with attitude, customizable with different outfits and looks.

        Responsive controls: arrow keys/WASD for movement, spacebar or tap for attacks, and special action buttons for abilities.

        Movement is smooth and can be diagonal, with inertia for modern feel.

        The attack style changes as the game progresses (e.g., hair whip, purse swing, witty comeback, dance moves).

    Enemies:

        Regular "guys" approach in fun, exaggerated ways—think flirty, overconfident, or silly.

        Each guy has a distinct animation/personality, making encounters memorable.

        Some may use quirky "pick-up lines" as projectile attacks; some may dance, run, or throw gifts.

        Difficulty and enemy variety increase with each level.

    Boss Levels (Ex-Boyfriends):

        Every 5th level, the player faces a boss—her ex-boyfriend.

        Each boss has a unique attack pattern and a mini story intro.

        Bosses use "emotional attacks" like “guilt trips,” “bad memories,” “jealousy blasts,” or “cringe texts.”

        To defeat a boss, the player must learn and dodge patterns, and time attacks.

2. Progression & Power-Ups

    Leveling Up:

        Each level gets progressively harder.

        At the end of each level, the player chooses from three random power-ups (e.g., faster attacks, health boosts, temporary shield, super witty comeback).

    Collectibles:

        Collect “self-love hearts,” “confidence stars,” and “red flags” to unlock abilities or outfits.

        Temporary power-ups appear during levels (e.g., freeze time, area-of-effect laugh, “ignore” shield).

    Special Abilities:

        “Glow Up” mode: Temporary invincibility and double power.

        “Call Your Bestie”: Summons a friend for a tag-team attack.

3. Art & Audio Direction

    Visuals:

        Modern, vibrant, and clean art style—pastel neons, bold outlines, smooth character animations, particle effects.

        Animated backgrounds that evolve (e.g., coffee shop, club, street, rooftop).

        Subtle parallax effects for depth.

    UI/UX:

        Ultra-modern HUD with soft shadows, rounded corners, glowing highlights.

        Minimal but stylish menus with animated transitions.

        Responsive UI for mobile: thumb-friendly buttons and swipes.

    Sound:

        Upbeat, catchy background music with variations for each level and boss.

        Distinct sound effects for attacks, power-ups, and emotional boss attacks.

        Character voice snippets for taunts and comebacks (option to mute).

4. Features & Quality-of-Life

    Customization:

        Unlockable outfits, hairstyles, and accessories as rewards.

        Change character style from the main menu.

    Accessibility:

        Adjustable difficulty, subtitles for all dialogue and taunts.

        Colorblind-friendly mode.

    Achievements & Leaderboards:

        Track high scores, fastest boss defeats, most creative combos, etc.

        Local and global leaderboards (using browser storage or optional login).

    Save & Resume:

        Progress automatically saves in the browser; continue from last level.

5. Onboarding & Storytelling

    Quick Tutorial:

        The game starts with a quick, interactive tutorial on movement, attacks, dodging, and power-ups.

        Story intro: Set up her motivation in a fun, lighthearted way (“It’s time to level up, break old cycles, and take on the past—literally!”).

    Mini Cutscenes:

        Before each boss, a short comic-panel style cutscene showing the ex-boyfriend’s theme and why he’s the “boss.”

    Victory/Loss Screens:

        Playful, uplifting messages. If defeated, a “pep talk” and instant retry option.

6. Final Touches

    Ultra-Smooth Animations:

        All transitions and actions are fluid—no jank.

        Modern effects: glow trails, confetti, and particle splashes when defeating enemies.

    Performance:

        Should load fast, run smoothly even on mobile, and handle touch as well as keyboard input.

    No Downloads, No Sign-Up Required:

        Fully browser-based, instant play. All features should work offline after first load.

DELIVERABLE:
A ready-to-run browser game matching all the above specs, with well-organized and commented code for easy expansion and future feature additions. The UI and gameplay should feel as modern and delightful as the best indie games on the web.

SUMMARY:
Build an ultra-modern, funny, and highly playable browser game where a girl fights off waves of guys and faces her ex-boyfriends as bosses. Focus on intuitive controls, stylish visuals, fun progression, and memorable moments—all fully playable in-browser, no installs or sign-ups.
